# VHDL model

This should implement the same ISA as the emulator, but aims to be
synthesizable inside an FPGA or ASIC.

## Core

The main CPU core (`cpu`) has separate 64 bit instruction and 32 bit data
buses that are fully synchronous and assumes that any memory interface or
peripherals are external.

## Testbench

Testbenches can be run automatically using the `sim.sh` script, and require
GHDL to run, and GtkWave to inspect the waveform data.

### CPU testbench

This testbench loads the "Hello world" example binary, and executes it in
the CPU, then terminates when the CPU stops.
